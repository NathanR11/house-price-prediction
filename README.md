Project for predicting housing prices in King County, WA

The purpose of this project is to predict real estate price on a home in King County, Washington State based on several independent variables
using various machine learning models.  Within the Jupyter notebook file, you will see the independent variables used for analysis - contains 20 unique features. 

Overall, we would like to examine the following questions throughout the project:

1) Does the set of independent variables accurately describe the dependent variable?
2) Which variables prove significant predictors of the dependent variable and what way do they impact the dependent variable?

Throughout the analysis, I followed the process as defined below:

1) Performed basic EDA for the dataset
2) Performed data cleaning of the dataset
3) Create training and testing datasets for machine learning models
4) Analyzing the machine learning models used, estimating the models by fitting the line and evaluating the validity of the model
